There are many more updates for this library.  In order of the
value/work tradeoff:

- Add a version() function to return a triple of major, minor, point release
- Add some fun class decorators like:
  a.  transmogrify (modify entire dictionary for renaming or adding functions),
  b.  warn_pep_8 (warn on pep 8 calling mistakes instead of failing), 
  c.  workflow (enforce a workflow and cleanup system).
- Add much log function usage
- Clean up packaging and code organization.  No more "dectools.dectools"
- Compile and run on Python 3.1
- Add basic routines for caches and locks
- Write a simi-reasonable project page or pick one from elsewhere.
- Update documentation on with non-constructors (@call_instead()), and lots of
  "how do I do this" examples
