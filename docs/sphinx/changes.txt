Changes Between Versions
========================

Version Plan
------------
Expect that the minor version number will change rapidly, usually whenever 
minor API changes are introduced.  I do not expect to keep the version number
under 1.0 for six years:  I never understood that trend.  Until I get significant
feedback on the module, expect the API to change randomly.
